Where to find nice 3DS-Models:
- http://www.3dtotal.com/    -> Free Stuff -> models
- http://www.amazing3d.com/free/free.shtml

To use textures that can be downloaded with the models, 
you have to copy the texture files in the folder of the application.
Otherwise no textures are loaded. This will be more comfortable
in later version of the 3ds-loader.

Very nice models are:
- Taxi with nice materials and glasses with alpha effects:
